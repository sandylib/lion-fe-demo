This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

###  Please follow the steps below (the mock api server must running first)

- first run `npm install` inside server folder (this is mock backend, so I don't like the libary install react app projects, this whole folder could remove totally when there is backend api ready)

- second, run `npm install` inside the root of this project, this install client need libarary

- third, run `npm run dev` this will start the mock api server in `localhost:8081`

- finally, you could run `npm start` or `yarn start`  start the react application

## Be aware that this did not follow TDD, the unit tests are just for demo skillability purpose

### run `npm test` then  `type a` will run  all of written unit tests

## There is only one testing account (detail below), otherwise it will be redirected to the not-found page (not stying)

the backend did in purpose will random delay, make sure could visible the spinning and changes
